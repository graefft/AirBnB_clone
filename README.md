# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The Console
## The Holberton B&B

### About
Command interpreter to manage AirBnb objects
* Parent class (`BaseModel`) to take care of initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances
* Flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* Creates all classes used for AirBnb (`User, State, City, Placeâ€¦`) that inherit from BaseModel
* Creates the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage
* Creates all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## Usage
Like the Unix shell, the HBnB console works in both interactive and non-interactive modes. In interactive mode, it prints a prompt and waits for input from the user.


#### Interactive Mode
To begin interactive mode, run ```./console.py``` from the command line

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
----|----
```(hbnb) quit``` | Quits console
```(hbnb) EOF``` | Quits console via EOF
```(hbnb) help <command>``` | Display help for <command>
```(hbnb) create <class>``` | Create object and print id
```(hbnb) show <class> <id>``` | Show information about an object
```(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>``` | Destroy object
```(hbnb) all <class>``` | Show all instances of a class
```(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value>``` | Creates or updates the attribute of a class



The commands create, show, destroy, all, and update can also be ran with the following syntax:  
```<class>.<command>(<optional id>, <optional arguments>)```

Running the ```update()``` function to create a new instance of 'middle_name' for the User class this way would look like this: 
```update.User("123-123-123-123", middle_name, Davmas)```

#### Non-interactive Mode
From a bash-like command line echo ```"<command>"``` and pipe to ./console.py

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
```


## Running the Tests
To run unittests for this program, cd into root directory and run the following command:
`python3 -m unittest discover tests`

Tests can be modified in the [tests](./tests/) directory


## Files Used in this Project
Models for all classes are located in the [models](./models/) directory.
